**T5Model:** Is the basic implementation of T5 architecture. It includes both the encoder and the decoder components, but without any task specific heads, it only returns the raw hidden states of the decoder as output.

**T5ForConditionalGeneration:** Is a specific configuration of T5Model tailored for conditional generation tasks. It includes all the functionalities of T5Model but is designed to handle tasks where the model needs to generate an output based on the provided input. This is particularly useful for tasks like language translation, summarization, and text completion. It's essentially a T5Model with pre-configured settings for conditional generation.

**T5EncoderModel:** Is a variant of the T5 architecture that only includes the encoder component. It is useful when you only need to encode input text and use the contextual embeddings for downstream tasks. For example, you might want to use T5EncoderModel for tasks like text classification or text similarity, where you don't require the decoder for generating text.
